## Prerequisites
Mke sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Access Credentials: You need to obtain MongoDB link in the MongoDB site
- Environment Setup: Configure your development environment to make HTTPS requests to our API endpoints. Also need to install required dependencies.

## Environment Setup
Start a new Node.js project with below command line below and it will create a new package.json file for our project:
```
npm init
```

Install our Node.js dependencies:

## Frontend Integration
This project provides simple HTML, EJS views, CSS and Javascript for the frontend.

## Error Handling - logging
We will use Winston logging library to log information for error handling. I have implemented it in this app so whenever you run an API, you can view the logs in your terminal or command prompt while your Node.js application is running.

## Install SSL Certificates(Optional)
We are using HTTPS make request and below are the steps to install SSL certificates. SSL certificates allow web servers to encrypt their traffic, and also offer a mechanism to validate server identities to their visitors. Websites using SSL are accessed via the https:// protocol.

- Generating a CSR 
```
openssl genrsa -out key.pem
```

- Generating a Private Key
```
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem
```

- Installing a Certificate On Your Server
```
openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem
```
